# Robot-Control
Wrote a script in Python to generate the quintic trajectories and design boundary layer-based sliding mode control laws for the z, φ, θ, ψ coordinates of the quadrotor to track desired trajectories zd, φd, θd, and ψd from the equations of motion for this quadrotor. A ROS node was then implemented to evaluate the performance of the controller design
